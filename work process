Step 1. We begin by importing the random module, which we will use to randomly select the computer's choice.
Step 2. We create a list of the available choices: rock, paper, and scissors.
Step 3. We begin a while loop that will run until the user chooses to quit by entering 'q'.
Step 4. Inside the loop, we use the input() function to prompt the user to enter their choice: rock, paper, or scissors. We also give the user the option to quit by entering 'q'. The user's input is stored in the user_choice variable.
Step 5. We check if the user entered 'q' to quit the game. If so, we break out of the while loop and end the game.
Step6. We check if the user's choice is a valid choice by verifying that it is in the choices list. If the user's choice is not valid, we print an error message and return to the beginning of the loop to prompt the user again.
Step7. We use random.choice(choices) to randomly select the computer's choice from the choices list. The computer's choice is stored in the computer_choice variable.
Step8. We use a series of if statements to determine the winner of the game based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors. 
   If the user's choice is the same as the computer's choice, the game is a tie. If the user's choice beats the computer's choice, the user wins. 
   If the computer's choice beats the user's choice, the computer wins. We print a message to indicate the winner.
Step9. The loop begins again, prompting the user to make another choice.
Step10. The loop continues until the user enters 'q' to quit the game, at which point we break out of the loop and end the game.
